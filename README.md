# Screenshot Generator

A simple and flexible utility for generating screenshots of webpages. This package allows you to capture a screenshot of a webpage either in **desktop** or **mobile** view, and saves it to a specified directory. It uses **Puppeteer** to automate the process of loading a webpage, simulating the viewport size (desktop or mobile), and capturing a screenshot.
